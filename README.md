SecureChain

Develop a dApp that secures all kinds of transactions by creating a multi-chain escrow account, whether it’s for mail-order purchases from order to delivery, for a contract from signature to fulfillment of its terms, no matter how complex and regardless of the amount involved. Users will be able to use this dApp for amounts in $, £, ¥, and €, etc. through the use of stablecoins.

For this dApp, it might be necessary to create a token on the Pi chain that would also enable the creation of a cross-chain bridge.
